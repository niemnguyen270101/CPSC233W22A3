My program does not fully function as I wish. I will explain why in the following lines. 

My program has:
- Title
- Menu Bar Parts
- Menu Bar Load Operation
- Menu Bar Save Operation
- Menu Bar Quit Operation
- Menu Bar About Operation
- Create World
- Hero/Monster
- Delete Entity 
- View World
- View details of Entity 
- Status 
- Readme.md
- .jar file

In order for my program to fully function, users should input every single TextFeild in the left scene.
